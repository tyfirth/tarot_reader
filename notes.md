# Alternately set up api with:

$ rails new *project-name* --api --database=postgresql
 This is to allow easy deployment to herokuapp

Is it too late for that?
A: I think I can update the database to postgres


Still need to do

- Create notes form to capture daily reading thoughts when creating a reading in createReading()...essentially naming the reading to get the id

- Display all readings

- Delete reading
